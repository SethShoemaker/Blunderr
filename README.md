# Blunderr

Blunderr is an application for organizations that need to manage help tickets
Once a registered user creates or joins an organization, they are given a role so that they can help manage their organization's incoming tickets.

## Roles

Blunderr uses roles to help manage each organization member's responsibility.
The roles are owners, managers, agents and clients.

#### Owners

The organization owner is able to many things. They manage the organization details like name and description. The manage the other organization members and their respective roles. And they Also can take on the job as the manager and assign agents to certain help tickets.

#### Managers

Managers are in charge of registering new projects that the organization is creating for clients. Once the organization owner assigns a client to that specific project, the manager can assign agents from their organization to the incoming help tickets. Once the assigned agent is satisfied with their solution, they will send it back to the managers where they can approve it.

#### Agents

Agents' primary responsibility is to create the solutions that the client needs. In their dashboard they will see a list of tickets that their managers have assigned them to complete. Once they are satisfied with their solution, they will send the ticket to the managers, and the ticket will be 'under review' until the managers are satisfied with the results.

#### Clients

The clients for the projects will have a means to submit help tickets for issues with their project. In their dashboard, they will have their own list of tickets submitted for their project, whether it be their own or another clients'. The list will list the tickets' statuses so that they can see progress being made on their ticket.
